The "Boosting model" directory includes a script that shows how boosting works in general.

The "input" directory is where the input dataset should store. Since it is not possible to upload a large file into github, this directory contains a description of where the dataset can be accessed rather than datasets themselves.

The "cnn" and "svm" directory includes the test we run regarding to cnn and svm.

The "working_directory" directory is, as its name suggests, the working directory we run our code to get the final results, together with the weights generated stored in files.
