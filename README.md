The "Boosting model" directory includes a script that shows how boosting works in general.

The "input" directory is where the input dataset should store. Since it is not possible to upload a large file into github, this directory contains a description of where the dataset can be accessed rather than datasets themselves.

The "cnn" and "svm" directory includes the test we run regarding to cnn and svm. Our cnn model has credit from https://www.kaggle.com/tivigovidiu/keras-model-for-beginners-0-210-on-lb-eda-r-d, "Keras Model for Beginners" 

The "working_directory" directory is, as its name suggests, the working directory we run our code to get the final results, together with the weights generated stored in files.

The pdf file in current directory is our project report, which provides detailed information about our work.
